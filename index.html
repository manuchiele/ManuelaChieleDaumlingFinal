    <p>
        When I was younger, about 3-4 years old, I would stay with a babysitter 
        while my parents worked. My mom would pick me up from the babysitter at 
        the end of her workday. At the time, she did not own a car, so she would 
        bike to work and to pick me up in her bike. She would put me in my little seat, 
        which was right in front of her, with basket right in front of me. She says 
        that on the way home, we would bike past trees and I would make her stop at 
        each tree so I could get a leaf from it and place it in the basket. I do not 
        remember this at all, but I remember being 10-11 years old and walking home 
        from school and doing the same thing without even knowing it was something 
        that I did when I was just a baby.
