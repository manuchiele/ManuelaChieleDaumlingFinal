    <h1>My Reasons To Live</h1>

    <p>
        I moved to the U.S. when I was 13 years old. At the age of 14, I started dealing with anxiety and a lack of motivation. 
        By 16, I was depressed and barely left my room. I isolated myself from everyone I knew, including myself. I repressed 
        parts of myself that I'm only able to access now that I'm almost 20 years old. In the last two years, I've been looking for 
        reasons to keep going and trying to find beauty in life again. The best thing I found was taking pictures of things I find beautiful. 
        I have a private Instagram where I share these pictures with my closest friends. I post pictures for every single day I've lived since 
        I started this little project. I have 732 posts at the moment. I can't imagine who I'd be if I hadn't started this Instagram; it helped 
        me a lot, especially in the darkest days. I take pictures of anything I find pretty, from leaves on the ground to my cat bathing in the 
        sunâ€”anything goes. It really makes you pay attention and notice how life is happening around you. I wish everyone could look at life as if
        they were a child still learning the names of things; it is so much brighter and more exciting. On this website, I will share some of my 
        favorite pictures that I've taken so far. I hope you enjoy and appreciate them as much as I do.
